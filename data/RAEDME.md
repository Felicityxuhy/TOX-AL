**TOXRIC dataset (see Genotoxicity_Ames Mutagenicity.csv).** The raw data used in this study was the C. Xu's Ames data collection45, which is one of the commonly used data sets for developing the prediction models. The entire database was prepared as follows46. Firstly, any inorganic molecules, that is, those without carbon atoms within the structure are removed. Secondly, the molecules with unspecified stereochemistry were removed. Thirdly, the molecules were standardized using the InChI key47. Finally, duplicates were identified and removed using the InChI key across the data collection. Ultimately, in total, 7485 compounds were used for the model building. The data sets contained 4196 mutagens and 3289 non-mutagens. The dataset is available in https://toxric.bioinforai.tech/home. 

**Liâ€™s dataset (see independent_test_new1.csv)**. The dataset was constructed from data sourced from three distinguished databases: the Chemical Carcinogenesis Research Information System (CCRIS), the National Toxicology Program (NTP), and the Instituto Superiore di Sanita for Salmonella Typhimurium (ISSSTY). Further refinement was achieved by removing samples that were duplicates of those found in the Ames dataset, thus establishing a new, independently verified external test set. Statistical analysis of the dataset was shown in Supplementary Figure 2.
