This is the official implementation of TOX-AL. In this work, we propose **TOX-AL**, **a task-independent deep active learning framework**, which could accurately predict molecule mutagenicity with fewer samples. The framework comprises four parts: the feature extraction module, the backbone module, the uncertainty estimation module and the loss calculation module. In TOX-AL, five features of the molecule are extracted by the feature extraction module, the backbone module is used to predict the mutagenicity of the molecule, a simple and efficient uncertainty estimation module is used for estimating the most valuable samples.
